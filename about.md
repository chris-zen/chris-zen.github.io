When I was 12 years old I started to program MSX and PC computers for fun. Started with BASIC but rapidly got interested on the internals and learned 8086 assembly and debugged MS-DOS 2.0. Since then I have played with many many languages and technologies.

Driven by my passion for software engineering and my interest in genomics I have faced several challenges in the field of computational cancer genomics during the last years in Barcelona ([IntOGen](http://www.intogen.org), [FannsDB](http://bg.upf.edu/fannsdb/), [Gitools](http://www.gitools.org/), [Blog](http://bg.upf.edu/blog/author/christian/)), and now I am working as a software engineer for TripAdvisor in Ireland.

I really enjoy learning new things, I am currently interested in distributed systems and data processing at a scale. I closely follow several languages ([Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/)), technologies ([Akka](http://akka.io/), [Play](https://www.playframework.com/), [Finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/), [Finatra](http://twitter.github.io/finatra/), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/), [Docker](http://www.docker.com/), [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/), ...), best practices (architectures and scalability, continuous delivery, API design, agile methodologies and teams organization, ...), and reference companies ([Twitter](https://engineering.twitter.com/), [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/), [Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/), ...).
