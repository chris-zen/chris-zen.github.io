When I was 12 years old I started to program MSX and PC computers for fun. Started with BASIC but rapidly got interested on the internals and learned 8086 assembly and debugged MS-DOS 2.0. Since then I have played with many many languages and technologies.

Hopefully I will find some time to share some of my experiences with software development in this blog.
